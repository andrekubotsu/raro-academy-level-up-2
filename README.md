# LevelUP#2

Another Raro Academy's assignment. We continued the development of a calculator that was started during classes. 

**Topics covered:**
- Buttons
- Buttons styles / customization
- Containers, Flex, Expanded
- setState()
- GridView and SingleChildScrollView
- Text

**Calculator Algorithm**

I decided to do it the hard way. Why? It was a great oppotunity to study and learn more Dart. It is not 100% finished, it contains some errors in more complex operations involving percentage calculation. However, it allows you to concatenate several simple operations into a single sequence.

**Dependencies**
- flutter_staggered_grid_view: ^0.4.0
